There are also github projects					
I haven't included them because they don't have a demo and almost always lack features descriptions and deployment guides. Also better to use more popular solutions (they are more tested and more developed)

Other ones are not open source and/or cloud-based. For example, PaperShala, Think Exam, Mettl Examine, Eklavvya, Testpress, Examsoft, Edbase, QuizCV.					
					
					
There are also solutions that claim they are open-source, but they can't be freely download. I guess they are paid. And to view a demo you need to request it.					
Examples: Blackboard Open LMS
