## Key conclusions

**Inducements are more likely to work if a program incentivizes things students feel they can control**. In technical terms, that means rewarding inputs instead of outputs. **Students don’t necessarily know how to improve their test scores, so even if they’re motivated to try harder, that doesn’t mean they can actually do better. **"If the incentive is tied to the performance on the test, the effects are small if there at all. But if you tie it to the preparation for the test, the studying, like incentivizing reading a book or doing practice tests … that tends to have much bigger effects."

**This seems to work best as a short-term intervention, not something that can improve school performance over the long haul.**

**Incentives are also more likely to work for students who only need a little improvement to earn a passing grade on a test**. Because: "If you’re miles away from it, no matter how much effort you put in, the odds of reaching are still low, so why bother?"

Paying students sometimes resulted in improvements in behaviors that enabled them to earn better grades. For instance, financial incentives led students to read more books that, in turn, resulted in higher reading comprehension scores. But **simply paying for higher test scores had no measurable effect, and students did not maintain the level of academic improvement once the incentive program ended. **

**Financial inducements has more effect on low-income families**. “Financial incentives provide useful tool that can be leveraged to improve the performance of disadvantaged groups and reduce achievement gaps.”

Intrinsic motivation is shown to be an important part of school success. **Rewards are shown to undermine intrinsic motivation and negatively affect learning.**

“There’s also a larger debate about** making learning transactional, **said Douglas Harris, professor of economics and the director of Education Research Alliance at Tulane University. "If your goal is to instill a love of learning, paying students to read books doesn’t really do that," he said. "It doesn’t reflect a view of teaching and learning that most educators support. **They don’t want it to be transactional.”**

**Sometimes, paying for grades has a lasting impact, while at other times, it provides a short boost.**

“Overall effects of incentive schemes on volitional outcomes, such as attending school and taking exams, were near zero in primary schools but were positive in secondary schools, perhaps because most students were already attending school without incentives and many of the remainder continue to avoid school even when incentives are in place. As expected, **effects on outcomes that are not directly volitional, such as attainment and learning, were minimal**. Effects on attendance were more likely to be seen in developing countries than in developed ones.”

The Coshocton incentive program was  a  cost  effective  program focusing on elementary school test scores,  which  led  to  substantial  math  test  score  gains,  especially  for  students at the bottom and top of the test score distribution. **The  results  are positive and significant in math but not in reading, social science, or science. **

Higher achieving students are more likely to increase performance in response to incentives to do so. Some studies indicate that the lowest performing students fail to increase their achievement while other studies show the **opposite**. Some studies indicate improvement for females** but not **males.

Most of the programs using ﬁnancial incentives to improve student outcomes are fairly new, with many unanswered questions. Longer-run impacts are still being measured. Thus, it is **not entirely clear what the effects are** on graduation rates, college enrollment, and attitudes toward life-long learning.

**The treatment  effects  are  stronger  for  the  financial  incentives  than  the  non-financial incentives (particularly in science) but not dramatically so**. Given their low cost and the ease of administration, our results suggest that non-financial rewards provide a feasible and cost-effective alternative to financial incentives.

Research suggests that paying students to do well in school **could be counterproductive.** It creates what is called "extrinsic," or external, motivation, which can paradoxically reduce students' intrinsic, or internal, motivations.

A series of school-based field experiments in over 200 urban schools across three cities designed to better understand the impact of financial incentives on student achievement. In Dallas, students were paid to read books. In New York, students were rewarded for performance on interim assessments. In Chicago, students were paid for classroom grades. 

**The impact of financial incentives on student achievement is statistically 0, in each city The only statistically significant effect is on English-speaking students in Dallas.**

An obvious interpretation of our results is that all the estimates are essentially 0 and the effects on English speakers in Dallas were observed by chance alone. Yet the size of the results and the consistency with past research on the importance of reading books cast doubt on this as an explanation ( Kim 2007 ; Allington et al. 2010 ). A second interpretation is that the only meaningful effects stem from English speakers in the Dallas experiment and this is likely due to younger children in the experiment.

No hard data has been released as of yet to the general public for review. However, a recent article published by the Associated Press mentions that rewards programs to students in New York City **had no effect on test scores or attendance for low performing high school students,** and in fact the programs made only modest differences for high achieving students (Kugler, 2010). The program that began in 2007 awarded a total of $14 million to 2,400 participating families not only for students performing better in school but also for adults to keep a job. Mayor Bloomberg stated that the program did not work.

Though the intention of the programs is to motivate students to improve their academic performance, **policymakers may not have thoroughly considered the psychological and moral ramifications of this strategy,** not to mention the possibility that paying students for grades may actually have adverse effects on student motivation over the long-term. Given the potential for widespread negative effects of educational policies that provide students with monetary rewards for academic achievement,alternative approaches for boosting student achievement should be considered

Limited research on financial incentives in developed countries shows potential, but **the picture is mixed.** The UK Education Maintenance Allowance added 5.9 percentage points to the number of young people who remained in full-time education after age 16, but there were no differences in post-16 achievement. In the US, evaluations of Learnfare and other programs emphasizing reductions in welfare payments for failure to attend school mostly had disappointing outcomes.  It may be that positive incentives for attendance will work better than sanctions for failure to attend, but this remains to be seen.


## Some interesting considerations

“The problem with incentives is that they are inefficient and counter-productive. If you pay people to read books, even the people who already read books without pay will be paid. But worse, once you stop paying them, many of the people who read books will stop reading them, both those who previously did not do so and those who previously did.”

“Financial rewards for attendance in a school with a high proportion of students eligible for free lunch might be the critical difference for a family if the reward is based on short-term objectives -- perhaps even weekly or bi-weekly. In districts with a high number of students whose families are migrant farm workers, such incentives, if substantial, might be the difference between the family keeping or taking the child out of school late or early so the adults and older children can begin to work in the fields, vineyards and orchards. Perhaps we ought not to think of those as financial rewards for attendance but as subsidies with the force of true commitment to contributing to the survival and well-being of the family so the youngster(s) can concentrate on school.”

“Paying people to do their jobs works. Paying people to do their jobs well normally results in increased productivity and efficiency. Nobody works for free (except for volunteers), and the best qualified, most productive workers get paid more. That's just the way it is, increased monetary compensation is a great incentive. However, paying kids to do well in school is perceived as counterproductive, wrong, and even unethical. Why? Paying students for higher test scores is unwise, but paying them for DOING BETTER in school actually works. By doing better I mean completing homework and all other assignments, paying attention in class, getting good grades in all assignments (not just tests), getting actively involved in their own education, displaying good citizenship, and becoming responsible for their own learning.

If we respond to financial incentives, why do we expect children to be different, especially teenagers, who love and need money as much as we do.”


## Arguments for and against


### **Arguments for:**



*   Cash-for-grades programs may jump-start students’ motivation by providing real-world rewards for their effort and performance. Proponents liken these rewards to an adult getting a raise or bonus for performing well on a job.
*   Advocates like Chicago mayor Richard Daley and Washington, D.C., school chancellor Michelle Rhee argue that these programs “level the playing field” for low-income kids, since middle- and upper-class families are able to offer their kids cash incentives for academic achievement. They say that for low-income students their situation calls for more drastic, less conventional measures. Many of these kids don’t understand the value and power of education. They may have few adult role models – at home or in their community – who are successful as a result of getting a solid education. Inner-city kids must also resist the lure of gangs or committing crimes to make money. Their worldview may be limited to the “here and now in the ‘hood” – and cash incentives may be an effective tool for getting their attention in school.
*   Students receive tangible rewards and reinforcement at frequent intervals, to maintain their motivation.
*   Some cash-incentive programs also encourage long-term effort and accountability. For example, a student earning an “F” is disqualified and must forfeit the rewards she’s earned to date. And holding back a portion of a student’s reward money until he graduates from high school may keep him focused on the larger goal.


### **Arguments against:**



*   Simply offering financial incentives to students doesn’t address the myriad factors that make up a quality education. Teacher training (and compensation), a solid curriculum, interesting electives, parental involvement, alternative programs, cultural awareness and community support all contribute to student success.
*   Students should only be rewarded for true achievement, not for simply showing up at school or taking a test.
*   Psychologists Bob Brooks and Sam Goldstein explain that research by Edward Deci and others shows most children are, by nature, motivated to learn.”External motivators may be effective and well intended,” Goldstein says, “but they clearly work against the continued development of a child’s intrinsic (innate) motivation. Intrinsic motivation – participating at school for the sheer pleasure of learning – is soon eclipsed by the promise of external rewards, and a child’s natural enthusiasm for learning may be dampened. It doesn’t really teach kids the reward of learning for learning’s sake.” \
 What, then, about at-risk students who struggle in school? Goldstein and Brooks go on to explain that our education system has determined that students who struggle need a greater degree of external motivation to stay engaged in academic tasks. Yet it is exactly these students whose intrinsic (natural) motivation must be nurtured and reinforced.
*   Teneh Weller, who operates the High Expectations Parental Service in the San Francisco Bay Area, admits that money motivates kids. “But, while it might re-ignite kids’ motivation in the short term, we need to reinforce their intrinsic motivation to see lasting results,” Weller says.
*   Even skeptics with no knowledge of research on motivation ask, “What happens when the reward is no longer offered? Do schools have to keep raising the stakes to keep students engaged?”
